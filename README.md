# PatchTST for Vehicle Acceleration Prediction — Stage 1

---

## What this repository does

This code implements **PatchTST** (Nie et al., ICLR 2023) as the Transformer-based predictor for Stage 1 of the dissertation, extending the future work described in Section 5 of the PhD proposal.

**Task:** Given the last 10 timesteps (1.0 s) of four car-following features for a follower vehicle, predict its acceleration at the very next timestep (t+11, i.e. 0.1 s ahead).

**Three models are trained and compared for each of the 30 vehicles:**

| Model | Training data | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **User-Specific PatchTST** | 248 rows — that vehicle only | Privacy-preserving local learning baseline |
| **CDT with Full Data** | 7,440 rows — all 30 vehicles pooled | Centralised upper-bound baseline |
| **CDT with Limited Data** | ~270 rows — 9 random rows × 30 vehicles | Fair matched-data centralised comparison |

This mirrors the exact framework from the dissertation's Stage 1 study, replacing LSTM with PatchTST as the data-driven predictor while keeping all other experimental conditions identical.

- **Locations:** Southbound US-101 (Los Angeles, CA) + Eastbound I-80 (Emeryville, CA)
- **Resolution:** 0.1 seconds (10 Hz)
- **Total vehicles in database:** 1,000
- **Vehicles used in this study:** 30 (randomly selected)
- **Observations per vehicle:** 350

**Download:** https://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/trafficanalysistools/ngsim.htm  
See `data/README.md` for the required CSV format.

### Input features (4 channels)

| Feature | Description | Unit |
|---|---|---|
| `velocity` | Follower vehicle speed | m/s |
| `delta_x` | Positional gap between follower and leader | m |
| `delta_v` | Speed difference: follower − leader | m/s |
| `acceleration` | Current follower vehicle acceleration | m/s² |

### Dataset split

| Split | Rows | Sliding-window blocks |
|---|---|---|
| Training (per vehicle) | 248 (~70 %) | **238** |
| Test (per vehicle) | 102 (~30 %) | **92** |
| CDT Full Data (all 30 vehicles) | 7,440 | 7,430 |
| CDT Limited Data | ~270 | 260 |

### Sliding window

```
Block 0  :  X = [t1, t2, ..., t10]  →  y = t11
Block 1  :  X = [t2, t3, ..., t11]  →  y = t12
...
Block 237:  X = [t239, ..., t248]   →  y = t249
```

Each block feeds 10 × 4 features into PatchTST and predicts a single scalar acceleration value.

## Model: PatchTST

**Full name:** Patch Time Series Transformer  
**Paper:** Nie et al., "A Time Series is Worth 64 Words: Long-term Forecasting with Transformers," ICLR 2023  
**HuggingFace:** https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite/granite-timeseries-patchtst

### Architecture

```
Input: (batch, 10 timesteps, 4 features)
    │
    ├─ Patch tokenisation  (patch_length=2, stride=2)
    │   10 steps ÷ 2 = 5 patch tokens per channel
    │
    ├─ Channel-independent embedding  (d_model=64)
    │   4 channels share weights, processed independently
    │
    ├─ Positional encoding  (sinusoidal)
    │
    ├─ Transformer encoder × 2 layers
    │   4 attention heads · FFN dim=128 · dropout=0.1
    │
    ├─ Prediction head  (prediction_length=1)
    │   Output: (batch, 1, 4)
    │
    └─ Regression head  Linear(4 → 1)
        Output: (batch,)  predicted acceleration  (m/s²)
```

**Why PatchTST over LSTM?**  
- Patching creates richer tokens than raw scalars, letting attention compare temporal segments directly  
- Self-attention captures global dependencies across the 10-step window in parallel, vs. LSTM's sequential recurrence  
- Channel-independence matches the dissertation's feature structure and enables direct comparison with the LSTM baseline  
- Academically established benchmark (ICLR 2023, widely cited)

## Evaluation protocol

Identical to the dissertation's Stage 1 evaluation:

1. **Bootstrap MSE:** 50 independent trials, each drawing 20 samples **without replacement** from the 92 test blocks
2. **Confidence interval:** Student-t 95 % CI computed from the 50 MSE values (`df = 49`)
3. **Statistical significance:** CI non-overlap between two models ≡ ANOVA alternative hypothesis H₁ (statistically significant difference)

## Key configuration values

All values live in `config.py`. The most commonly adjusted:

```python
# Sliding window (Stage 1)
INPUT_STEPS   = 10   # input timesteps (1.0 s of history)
HORIZON_STEPS = 1    # 1-step ahead prediction (next timestep)

# PatchTST
D_MODEL    = 64      # embedding dimension
NHEAD      = 4       # attention heads
NUM_LAYERS = 2       # encoder layers
DROPOUT    = 0.1

# Training
EPOCHS              = 300
LR                  = 1e-3
EARLY_STOP_PATIENCE = 10
BATCH_SIZE          = 32

# Evaluation (matches dissertation)
N_BOOTSTRAP_TRIALS = 50
BOOTSTRAP_SAMPLE   = 20

# CDT limited dataset (matches dissertation seed)
LIMITED_N    = 9
LIMITED_SEED = 12
```

**Stage 2 upgrade:** To extend to 2.5-second horizon (Stage 2), change only `HORIZON_STEPS = 25` in `config.py`. All sliding-window logic adjusts automatically.

## Relation to the dissertation

This repository implements the **future work** from Section 5 of the PhD proposal:

> *"Extend the data-driven model family to a more modern architecture. Our initial investigation used IDM, Helly, and an LSTM to establish proof-of-feasibility under limited per-vehicle data. As a next step, we will evaluate a more expressive sequence model (e.g., a Transformer-based predictor) under the same User-specific and federated protocols. This pertains to Stage 1."*

PatchTST replaces LSTM as the data-driven predictor. All other conditions are held constant: same dataset (NGSIM, 30 vehicles), same train/test split (248/102 rows), same three-model comparison (User-Specific vs CDT Full vs CDT Limited), same evaluation protocol (bootstrapped MSE, 95 % CI, CI overlap test).
